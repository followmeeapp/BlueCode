==============

By Karl Stenerud

### A better reachability for a modern age.


Introduction
------------

A long time ago in an Xcode far away, Apple provided "Reachability", an example Objective-C wrapper to demonstrate the SystemConfiguration Reachability APIs. On the whole it works well enough, but it could be so much more!

KSReachability takes reachability to the next level.


Features
--------

- Reachability to the network in general, to a host, or to an IPV4 or IPV6 address.
- Notifications/callbacks via NSNotification, blocks, and KVO.
- Fetching status values doesn't block.
- Callbacks and KVO always occur on the main thread, so it's UI-safe.
- KSReachableOperation: A one-shot operation to perform when reachability is established.
- Supports iOS and Mac OS X.
- Can be built with or without ARC, in CLANG or GCC.

Usage
-----

#### Import:
    #import "KSReachability.h"

#### Create a KSReachability object:
    self.reachability = [KSReachability reachabilityToHost:hostname];

#### Use blocks:
    self.reachability.onReachabilityChanged = ^(KSReachability* reachability)
    {
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (blocks)", reachability.reachable);
    };

#### Or use NSNotifications:
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(onReachabilityChanged:)
                                                 name:kDefaultNetworkReachabilityChangedNotification
                                               object:nil];
    ...

    self.reachability.notificationName = kDefaultNetworkReachabilityChangedNotification;
    ...

    - (void) onReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification*) notification
    {
        KSReachability* reachability = (KSReachability*)notification.object;
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (NSNotification)", reachability.reachable);
    }

#### Or use KVO:
    [self.reachability addObserver:self
                        forKeyPath:@"reachable"
                           options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew
                           context:NULL];
    ...

    - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath
                          ofObject:(id)object
                            change:(NSDictionary *)change
                           context:(void *)context
    {
        KSReachability* reachability = (KSReachability*)object;
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (KVO)", reachability.reachable);
    }

#### Add a reachable operation:
    // Create a one-shot operation that gets fired once the host is reachable.
    self.reachableOperation = [KSReachableOperation operationWithHost:hostname
                                                            allowWWAN:NO
                                               onReachabilityAchieved:^
                               {
                                   [self showAlertWithTitle:@"One-time message"
                                                    message:@"Host is reachable!"];
                               }];

Caveats
-------

### The Meaning of Reachability

As per [Apple's SCNetworkReachability documentation](https://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/IOS/documentation/SystemConfiguration/Reference/SCNetworkReachabilityRef/Reference/reference.html), a remote host is considered reachable when a data packet addressed to that host **can leave the local device** (i.e. the host is **theoretically** reachable). It does **NOT** guarantee that data will actually be received by the host or that the host will respond to a connection request! For example, if the host has a DNS record, but the host itself is down, it will **still** be considered **reachable**.

### Delays Due to DNS Lookups

KSReachability must do a DNS lookup to determine reachability to a host by name. Since this lookup can take upwards of 10 seconds in extreme cases, it is performed in the background. As a consequence, a newly created KSReachability object will always have its state set to unreachable until this lookup completes. If you need the true reachability to a host, you must wait for the "initialized" property to change to YES (it supports KVO). As an alternative, you can set the callback "onInitializationComplete".


Full Example
------------

I've included a full example project in this repository.

In **iOSReachability**, see **ViewController.h** and **ViewController.m** for details.

In **MacReachability**, see **AppDelegate.h** and **AppDelegate.m** for details.

      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
